Second edition of the virtual reality art gallery for TAMK's Fine Art graduates.

The gallery is designed for HTC Vive and Vive Pro devices. It's built with Unity and the VRTK framework. 
My role in this project consisted mainly of C# and ShaderLab programming and, to a lesser extent, designing interaction models and building scenes in Unity.
