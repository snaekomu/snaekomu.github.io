First edition of the virtual reality art gallery for TAMK's Fine Art graduates.

Made for the original HTC Vive, the gallery features several artworks of graduating students of TAMK's Fine Art programme in 2018. It was built in Unity using the VRTK framework. My role in the project was C# programming and designing and building scenes, together with the artists themselves.
