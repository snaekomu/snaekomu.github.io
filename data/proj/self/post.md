# This site

This project was built on request from Annisto Oy, who wanted an AR app to complement the art pieces installed on the pedestrian crossing connecting Tampere's Vuores neighbourhood with Annisto farm. The app fetches images and videos taken by the farm's staff from a remote server, allowing them to easily update its content remotely.

The project consists of three different parts:
- An AR app made with Unity and Vuforia
- A RESTful API powered by Express.js and MongoDB
- A custom CMS frontend built with Next.js and React
