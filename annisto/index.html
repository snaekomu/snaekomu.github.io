The app fetches images and videos taken by the farm's staff from a remote server, allowing them to easily update its content remotely.</p>
<p>The project consists of three different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mobile app made with Unity and Vuforia</li>
<li>A RESTful API powered by Express.js and MongoDB</li>
<li>A custom CMS frontend built with Next.js and React</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mobile-app"><a href="#mobile-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mobile app</h2>
<p>The mobile app client is rather straightforward, it's built on the Vuforia Engine platform and its role is to fetch data from the server and dynamically display the database contents. It's designed to be as simple as possible, offloading most configuration to the server so we can avoid updating it directly, since that could cause compatibility breaking updates and provide a negative experience for end users.</p>
<h2 id="rest-api"><a href="#rest-api" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>REST API</h2>
<p>This is the biggest part of the project, an API powered by Express.js and MongoDB. Its design has shifted a lot during the development process, to allow for flexibility and extensibility while at the same time remaining simple enough to make managing the CMS a trivial task.</p>
<p>Originally it was developed using MySQL, which is well suited for this application in production, but the quickly chaning nature of the project made developing with SQL tedious and slow. MongoDB's ability to quickly and easily modify schemas and relationships between collections made it an ideal choice for this project.</p>
<h2 id="cms-frontend"><a href="#cms-frontend" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>CMS Frontend</h2>
<p>The final piece of the project is a custom made CMS to manage the database. Making a custom CMS for this might seem like a needlessly demanding task, but due to the structure of the database, the ready made headless CMSs I tried ended up creating a confusing and complicated managing experience, and with a custom made CMS fontend I was able to streamline the management workflow to make adding and removing content as simple as possible.</p>
